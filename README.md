# BankApp: A JavaFX Banking System

BankApp is an innovative mobile application designed to emulate the functionalities of a real-world banking system. Developed in Java, it features a user-friendly interface crafted with JavaFX, ensuring seamless user interactions. The application establishes secure database connections using JDBC and stores data in a MySQL database, providing a stable and reliable backend.

A key focus of the project was to implement robust user authentication mechanisms. Users can confidently log in with their credentials, knowing their data is protected. The project was also an educational journey into database management and the critical role of security in financial software.

To safeguard sensitive user information, the application employs a combination of advanced cryptographic techniques. Passwords are stored using SHA-3 (Secure Hash Algorithm 3), enhanced with salting to thwart unauthorized access attempts. This approach to security underscores the applicationâ€™s commitment to protecting user privacy.

Overall, the BankApp project was a valuable learning experience, significantly bolstering technical expertise and offering deep insights into designing software that prioritizes user needs and security.

## Features Implemented

1. **User Authentication**:
    - Users can log in using their credentials.
    - Passwords are securely hashed and stored in the database.

2. **Account Management**:
    - Users can view their account details (balance, account number, etc.).
    - Transactions (deposits, withdrawals) are recorded.

3. **Database Integration**:
    - JDBC is used to connect to the MySQL database.
    - Database schema includes tables for users, accounts, and transactions.
